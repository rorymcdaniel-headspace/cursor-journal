Summarize today's Cursor AI conversations for my dev-journal.

For each conversation in the JSON file, create an entry like:

## [HH:MM] Brief Summary
**Type:** feature | bugfix | refactor | infra | learning | planning
**Impact:** low | medium | high  
**Context:** [topic]

Brief description of what was accomplished.

**AI Assistance:** How AI helped

Rules:
- Skip empty or trivial conversations
- Use the conversation name for the summary
- Classify type based on first_message content
- Keep descriptions to 1-2 sentences
