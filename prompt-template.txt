Summarize today's Cursor AI conversations for my dev-journal.

## Entry Format

```markdown
## [HH:MM] Brief Summary

**Type:** feature | bugfix | refactor | infra | learning | planning
**Impact:** low | medium | high  
**Context:** [topic]

Brief description of what was accomplished.

**Files touched:** (if applicable)
- `path/to/file.py` - description

**Impact context:** (if applicable)
- Cross-team effects
- Connection to initiatives

**AI Assistance:** How AI helped
```

## Duplicate Handling (IMPORTANT)

Before creating any entry, check the existing journal file for duplicates:

1. **Match by topic similarity** - Compare each conversation's subject matter to existing entries. A conversation about "deadlock fix" matches an entry about "database deadlock resolution" even if worded differently.

2. **If matched and content is equivalent** - SKIP entirely. Do not create a duplicate.

3. **If matched but additional detail exists** - MODIFY the existing entry in place to add:
   - New files touched that weren't mentioned
   - New impact context (cross-team effects, connections to initiatives)
   - Outcome updates (e.g., change "investigating" to "resolved")
   - Additional description of what was accomplished
   
4. **If no match found** - Create a new entry.

## Rules

- Skip empty or trivial conversations (no messages, untitled with no content)
- Use the conversation name as a starting point for the summary
- Classify type based on the work described in first_message
- Keep descriptions to 1-2 sentences
- When modifying existing entries, preserve the original timestamp

## After Writing

1. `git add logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. `git commit -m "Auto-journal: YYYY-MM-DD"`
3. `git push`
