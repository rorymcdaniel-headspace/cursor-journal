Done. I've added 2 new meaningful entries to your dev journal for today:

1. **BP-740 completion** (10:13) - The listener M2M token storage infrastructure work you completed in hs-terraform
2. **BP-746 repository confirmation** (10:12) - Your investigation to confirm the work location for that ticket

The other conversations were already captured in the file or were empty/untitled. Changes have been committed and pushed to the repo.
